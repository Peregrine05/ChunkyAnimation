# ChunkAnimate
ChunkyAnimate is a plugin to the Minecraft path-tracer [Chunky](https://github.com/chunky-dev/chunky) which helps load
multiple json files to render a scene without having to completely reload Chunky on every frame. It is currently
a work in progress, but it is usable to make animations with json files generated by external tools such as 
[ChunkyAnimationAutomation](https://github.com/jackjt8/ChunkyAnimationAutomation).

## Download

## Usage
Upon opening Chunky, there will be a new tab called `Animation Controls`. Here you can choose a folder with json files
to load as an animation. Afterwards, click `Start Animation` to start automatically rendering animation frames. Click
`Stop Animation` to stop animating. The render reset button will **NOT** stop animating.

The resulting animation frames will be saved next to the initial scene under the `animate` folder.
